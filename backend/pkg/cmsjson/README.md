# CMSJson

CMSJson is our own custom in-house JSON marshalling library, the library marshalls JSON into an AST and verifies that the incoming JSON conforms to a specific type. After parsing and marshalling the generated AST supports the type-safe extension of the AST and allows the addition of substructures to the AST, the validity of these insertion/deletion operations is defined by the type provided when marshalling the type.
