We wont be able to use a normal english training set, because the strings we are processing have too much jargon, and aren't even proper english in a lot of cases.</p><p>The other is more fundamental. When NLP fails (by generating some function which is valid, but semantically incorrect), it fails SILENTLY. We have no clue that it failed, and many students would then go ahead and use our platform without either they or us knowing that there is a problem. This is a disaster, and the worst case scenario. It looks bad on optics if we fail loudly, but this is better than the alternative of having a student trust us and then get a progression check which tells them they can't graduate.</p>",
