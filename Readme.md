# Build Instructions
Building the app fresh after installation
run:
`docker compose up --build`

For all subsequent running of apps
run:
`docker compose up`
or
`docker compose up -d`


# postgres Instructions
access interactive terminal by running `docker exec -it pg_container bash`
now run this command `psql -d test_db -f infile` to load the dummy data we have prepared in ./postgres/infile



# DiffSync

Experimental respository for the CSESoc CMS, usage is simple; to build and run type

<b>Note: the code is ugly, the design is hacky but its just a prototype to flesh out ideas.</b>
```sh
make start
```
And go to `http://localhost:8080?document={what ever}`, other clients can connect at this same URL and start communicating :)
Live previews are served via: `http://localhost:8080/preview?document={what ever}`

# TODO
 - [ ] Reimplement diffmatchpatch from scracth instead of relying on a library
 - [ ] the library is rather outdated

The algorithm being used is an "uncommon?" algorithm so some papers outlining many of the algos used can be found here
